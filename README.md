# Machine Learning
Machine learning could be anything as long as we can convert them into numbers and program it to find the patterns. <br/>

Why use Machine Learning?
1. when the traditional approach fails to be programmed,
2. continuous changing environments,
3. discovering insights from large datasets.

Drawbacks:
1. results aren't always predictable
2. needs lots of data to train the model on

Types of Learning:
1. Supervised
2. Unsupervised
3. Semi-supervised
4. Reinforcement
5. Transfer learning

## Supervised learning: 
f(x: features) -> y:labels





## Algorithms to learn
1. Random Forest
2. Naive Bayes
3. Gradient Boost
4. Nearest neighbour
5. Support Vector Machine
